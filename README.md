# Project 0

My project is named "The SRT Hub".
This website is one that provides basic information on the different versions of the Dodge Challenger  SRT Hellcat.
The index file contains Html tags, the  Bootstrap CDN and its accompanying JS links.
These tags form the navbar, the body images, a jumbotron, some cards which apply the use of the bootstrap columns and spacing techniques
There also exists some classes  and ids that aid in the styling of the various html elements.
The style sheet file also consists of compiled sass and css properties and selectors.
The about page consists of a little write up about the page. Some formatting was applied to the text and a link to the official dodge website
The  pricing page also consists of a table that lists the different iterations of the challenger, their MSRPs and their respective horsepowers and release years
The reviews page only consists of different links to youtube. These links are car reviews  on the dodge  challenger.
I have tried to comply with the requirements for involving sass in this project which is contained in the style.scss file.
